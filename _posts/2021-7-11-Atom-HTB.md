### Web Enum
- Heed
![runningweb](/assets/atomHTB/runningweb.png)
- Dir listing and Host Fuzzing   
Both Gobuster and wfuzz returns nothing interesting :(

### SMB Enum
Access the SMB share with `smbclient`. Use the command
```bash
smbclient -L <target>
```
- Software_Updates Disk SMB Share
![software updates share](/assets/atomHTB/smbclient.png)
Inside, we found a pdf file which contains information about software QA testing. In this document, we were able to learn that:   
    - The software is using Electron builder   
    - There is some kind of auto-updater that works by getting data from one of the client folders in the share.   
![UAT](/assets/atomHTB/UAT-electron-clue.png)

### Researching Electron Builder
By simply googling, we found an vulnerability related to Electron Builder.   
![google result](/assets/atomHTB/googleresult.png)   
The article explains about a possible RCE by escaping the powershell command executed by Electron Builder while auto-updating app. This can be done by providing a valid release note (`latest.yml`) and a malicious executable with `'` in the middle of the name.
![Vuln Found](/assets/atomHTB/vulnbehindexploit.png)

### Exploitation Attempt
#### Generate Malicious `exe` file.   
Using `msfvenom`, we created a binary which will establish a reverse shell once executed.
![generate exe](/assets/atomHTB/genexensum.png)
#### Generate SHA512sum   
Using the command mentioned in the article above, we were able to generate the valid checksum
#### Create a Valid Release Note   
Create `latest.yml` file with necessary content.  
![latest.yml](/assets/atomHTB/latestyml.png)   
#### Upload Fake Valid Release Note to One of Client   
We were lucky enough to find the correct "one of the client" folder inside the share which is client2.
![putting latestyml](/assets/atomHTB/puttinglatestyml.png)
#### Host Malicious `exe` and Wait for Reverse Shell to connect   
![pop shell](/assets/atomHTB/poppinshell.png)
WE GOT A SHELL!
#### **EXPLOITATION SUCCESS!!!**

### Post Exploitation
#### Enumeration
We decided to wander around jason's folder and found `PortableKanban` in his `Downloads` folder.
![finding kanban](/assets/atomHTB/findingportablekanban.png)   
![kanban folder](/assets/atomHTB/insideportablekanban.png)   
Inside the folder, we found several files that seems like a legit application. Researching it on google brough us to the download page and password decryption exploit.

#### PortableKanban 
We decided to read the user guide inside the `PortableKanban` folder and here we found several information about possible password storing place.

#### Redis Password
Based on the Redis requirement of `PortableKanban`, a password for redis identified by `requirepass` will be available inside the config file `redis.windows-service.conf`. By looking at the content of the config file, we found a password in plain text.
![redispass](/assets/atomHTB/redispass.png)

#### Getting Admin Hash from Redis
With Redis password, we could access redis server and access admin's hashed password.
![Admin Hash](/assets/atomHTB/getadminhashfromredis.png)

#### Cracking Admin Password
To crack the password, we needed to go back to our google result and read through the password decryption exploit available on exploitdb. 
![exploit google](/assets/atomHTB/crackingpassword.png)
![exploit from exploitdb](/assets/atomHTB/exploitfromexploitdb.png)
To make it faster and easier, we just copied the `decode` function and pass the hash to the function.

### ROOTED
Log in with Evil-Winrm and we are admin!!
